Contributing
============

We are happy to have you contribute! The project is hosted on https://github.com/wayfair/pylift. The easiest way to get started is to check out the “Issues” and “Projects” sections of the repo.

In general, we have four main requirements for contribution:

1. **Contributions do not affect the default functionality of existing methods.** We want to make sure any new features or modifications still work with older code samples.
2. **Contributions should be accompanied by a unit test to ensure basic functionality (if applicable).** Tests are contained in the ``./tests/`` directory. The package is automatically tested on TravisCI with every push.
3. **Contributions are accompanied by documentation.**
4. **New methods are tested, well-understood, and have a defined purpose.**
